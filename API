Creating a unified API for using pre-trained models in PyTorch and TensorFlow is a valuable project that can simplify the work of AI practitioners. Below is an outline for your project:

# Unified Pre-trained Model API

## Overview

The Unified Pre-trained Model API project aims to provide a single, user-friendly interface for accessing and using pre-trained models in various deep learning frameworks, including PyTorch and TensorFlow. This unified API will enable AI practitioners to seamlessly switch between frameworks and leverage pre-trained models for a wide range of tasks, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), computer vision, and audio processing.

## Features

- Unified API: Develop a common API structure that abstracts the differences between PyTorch and TensorFlow, making it easier to work with pre-trained models.
- Model Compatibility: Support a diverse set of pre-trained models, including popular models like BERT, ResNet, and WaveNet.
- Task Flexibility: Allow users to use pre-trained models for tasks such as text classification, object detection, speech recognition, and more.
- Framework Independence: Users can choose their preferred deep learning framework (PyTorch or TensorFlow) without worrying about compatibility issues.
- Easy Integration: Provide comprehensive documentation and usage examples for quick integration into existing projects.

## Installation

```bash
pip install unified-pretrained-api
```

## Usage

```python
from unified_pretrained_api import UnifiedPretrainedModel

# Initialize the API with the desired framework
api = UnifiedPretrainedModel(framework="pytorch")

# Load a pre-trained model
model = api.load_model("bert-base-uncased")

# Perform inference on an input
input_data = "This is an example sentence."
output = api.infer(model, input_data)

print(output)
```
