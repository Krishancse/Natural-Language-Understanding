Implementing complete code examples for all the NLU-related ideas mentioned in your list would be quite extensive, as each idea represents a complex topic on its own. However, I can provide you with simplified code snippets to get you started on some of these concepts. Let's start with a few:

**1. Multilingual NLU:** You can use the `transformers` library to work with multilingual models. Here's an example using Hugging Face's Transformers library to translate text from English to French:

```python
from transformers import MarianMTModel, MarianTokenizer

# Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer for English to French translation
model_name = "Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr"
model = MarianMTModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = MarianTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Translate English to French
text = "Hello, how are you?"
inputs = tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors="pt")
translated = model.generate(inputs, max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1, decoder_start_token_id=model.config.pad_token_id)
translation = tokenizer.decode(translated[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(translation)
```

**2. Emotion Recognition:** You can build a basic emotion recognition model using machine learning libraries. Here's an example using the `textblob` library for sentiment analysis (a simplified form of emotion analysis):

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

# Analyze sentiment of text
text = "I love this product! It's amazing."
analysis = TextBlob(text)
emotion = "Positive" if analysis.sentiment.polarity > 0 else "Negative" if analysis.sentiment.polarity < 0 else "Neutral"
print(f"Emotion: {emotion}")
```

**3. Contextual Understanding:** Achieving deep context understanding typically involves using large pre-trained language models like GPT-3. You can use the OpenAI GPT-3 API to interact with such models for context-based tasks.

Please note that these examples provide only a basic starting point for each idea. More sophisticated and specialized implementations would require significant data, model training, and fine-tuning, which may go beyond the scope of a simple code snippet. Additionally, the other ideas on your list involve even more complex tasks and would require dedicated projects for their implementation.
